# Tyler Pettitt's Professional Portfolio
----
## About the Project
This project utilizes the MEVN stack(MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.js) to display my professional experience.
I have also configured MongoDB to have a development environment as well as a production environment to play around with when I have my local project spun up.
Some additional tooling used within the project include: moment.js, bootstrap, and bootstrap-vue components.
The project is hosted on heroku and can be found on my own domain [here](http://www.tylerpettitt.me "Pettitt Portfolio"). Give it a few seconds, I'm just using the free hosting as of now so the server may have to 'wake up'.

## To-Do List: 
  - [ ] Move storage of text descriptions to DB for easier updating
  - [ ] On-Scroll event to add 'back to top' button
  - [X] Add backend testing with Mocha/Chai(API partially done)
  - [X] Add Google Analytics
  - [X] Add message me button for visitors to send and email to me
  - [X] Update 'My Journey' section with better design
  - [X] API Authentication via JWT (not perfect but makes it harder to hit the API from outside the application)
  - [X] Finish Comments page to demonstrate CRUD operations with MongoDB
  - [X] Remove unused assets
