# Tyler Pettitt's Professional Portfolio
----
## About the Project
This project utilizes the MEVN stack(MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.js) to display my professional experience.
I have also configured MongoDB to have a development environment as well as a production environment to play around with when I have my local project spun up.
Some additional tooling used within the project include: moment.js, bootstrap, and bootstrap-vue components.
The project is hosted on heroku and can be found on my own domain [here](http://www.tylerpettitt.me "Pettitt Portfolio"). Give it a few seconds, I'm just using the free hosting as of now so the server may have to 'wake up'.
